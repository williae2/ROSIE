Restriction Of Service, Intended Ethically

In order to run the system, you need to install scapy, which does not like windows too much. There are resources out there to get it. To run it, you can either run newrosie.py in the command line like "py newrosie.py [GATEWAY IP] [TARGET IP] [IP FORWARDING]" Otherwise, you can copy the code from rosie.py and run scapy in the command line, then copy the code tehre and hit enter till you can enter a new command. Rosie(conf.route.route()[0], "gateway ip", "target-ip", False) is the command you want to follow, you also want to make sure ip_forwarding is enabled.
